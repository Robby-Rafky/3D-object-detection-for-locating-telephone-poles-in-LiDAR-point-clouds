# 3D-object-detection-for-locating-telephone-poles-in-LiDAR-point-clouds
My Master's Thesis Project on behalf of BT.

Project Features:
  - LiDAR Pointcloud to 2D image encoding.
  - Generation of training data from "Hot-spots".
  - Various data augmentation methods to bolster generated data.
  - Model training (from generated data or user supplied data)
